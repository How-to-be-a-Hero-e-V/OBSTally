# OBSTally
OBS Tallylights via OBS-Websockets and RPI

### THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND QUICK AND DIRTY
* But it works really good

### Installation
* Run pip install obs-websocket to install the obs-websocket Library

* Install and Setup NGINX and PHP-Server

* Put index.php in /var/www/html/

* In index.php change tally.xml-path to match the actual path

* Run index.php from Browser

* Setup OBS-Tally Settings (IP, Password, Port from OBS-Websockets, Scenes and GPIO-Ports)

* Connect LEDs to the matching GPIO and try

* If you want to use OBSTally with an relais-card, you need to use the Inverted-Version

### Contribution
I am:
* Pyton noob
* PHP noob
But it works. If you can improve some of my code, then feel free to push some.
